# Kaggle competition—Indoor Location & Navigation
## Language: Python(ipynb)
###  Description:
In this competition, our task is to predict the indoor position of smartphones based on real-time sensor data, provided by indoor positioning technology company XYZ10 in partnership with Microsoft Research. We'll locate devices using “active” localization data, which is made available with the cooperation of the user. Unlike passive localization methods (e.g. radar, camera), the data provided for this competition requires explicit user permission. We'll work with a dataset of nearly 30,000 traces from over 200 buildings.
